    <p>A platform to detect fake videos.</p>
    <p>Wait.. What!? that's a thing..</p>
    <p>Like, that's a THING...</p>
    <br />
    <p>In an age where video, as one the most important media, gets abused with fake contents.
    They created a tool to detect just that.</p>
    <p>What a noble task...</p>
    <br />
    <p>Shamir asked me to work with Roderick for this, so I helped Roderick on the frontend and it's API.</p>
