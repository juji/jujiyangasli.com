    <p>The First website of my creation, that i like. Developed with PHP, MySql.</p>
    <p>Using CPanel as a server management tool.</p>
    <p>It was 2012, i guess... I don't remember.</p>
    <p>
      I had a great time creating this site. The client was great: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tauziahotels.com/">https://www.tauziahotels.com/</a>.
      The designer was awesome: <a href="http://visious.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://visious.co/</a>.

    <p>
      I worked in visious at the time. The team was cute and heart warming.
      The kind of team that you would describe more as a group of friends having fun.

      Click the logo to see the menu and explore. I personaly like the page transition. There was no
      react and node.js.
      Just plain old PHP, mysql and an Apache Webserver.
