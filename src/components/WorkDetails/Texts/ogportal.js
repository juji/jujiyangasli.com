    <p>A Company Portal, for other companies..</p>
    <p>
      Hahah... this project was my basic pipedream in my younger years: to develop a company portal.
      I thank Brett of <a href="https://outsourcedglobal.com">Outsourced Global</a> for making that happen.
    </p>
    <p>It was amusing.. Took a month to finish, i guess... made from scratch. I loved it.</p>
    <p>
      The thing is, it's a company portal. The quintesential platform for companies.
      <br />It brought me to my happy place, can't get enough thinking about it..
      <br />A fundamental thing to develop, a company portal.

    <p>Yes, I'm a nerd.</p>
